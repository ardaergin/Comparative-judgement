Now that you are familiar with the task, we will continue with the main part of the study. As in the practice trials, we will show you products in the triad. In this part, we are interested in plant-based steaks.

Again, you will be asked to indicate which of the two plant-based steaks at the bottom of the screen is more similar to the beef steak on the top of the screen.

If the plant-based steak on the left is most similar, you press D.

If the plant-based steak on the right is most similar, you press K.

Please focus on the task and answer as fast as you can without thinking too much. We are interested in your initial responses.

Please click on the space key to start the practice trials.
